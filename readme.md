# Analytics for the Data-Driven Manager

A two-day workshop for mid-level managers to explore data-driven thinking and data analysis. Using relevant examples from U.S. cities, open data, and Microsoft Excel, we give participants a taste of how analysts ask and answer questions using data and how policymakers apply those insights to real-life scenarios.    

## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to:
+ Collaboratively scope an analytical problem using design thinking techniques
+ Develop an outcomes-focused process for answering an analytical question
+ Define data analysis and apply analytical skills to their everyday work
+ Consider data analysis as part of a larger organizational shift to data-informed decision making
+ Begin analysis by asking appropriate questions
+ Download a dataset from NYC Open Data Portal
+ Explore and visualize a dataset in Microsoft Excel
+ Interpret findings and test hypotheses
