# Analytics for the Data-Driven Manager

A two-day workshop for mid-level managers to explore data-driven thinking and data analysis. Using relevant examples from U.S. cities, open data, and Microsoft Excel, we give participants a taste of how analysts ask and answer questions using data and how policymakers apply those insights to real-life scenarios.    

## Learning Objectives
