#Data Analytics for Managers

A day-long workshop for civil servants to explore data-driven thinking and data analysis. Uses relevant examples from U.S. cities, open data and MS Excel to give students a taste of how analysts ask and answer questions using data and how policymakers apply those insights to real-life scenarios.
