???
+ Facilitators prompt students with the question "Why is data useful?" and/or "Why do we use it?"
+ Facilitators contrast this with the question "How would we make decisions without data?" to tease out the need for data to check assumptions and limited problem awareness
+ Facilitators carefully acknowledge that intuition, experience, and anecdotes can be useful but shouldn't be the sole source of knowledge and information

---

# Are All Data Points Created Equal?
???
+ Facilitators lead a brief discussion of the issues with data
+ Issues to be touched on include: data entry errors, biases in data, data cleaning errors, etc.
---

class:middle
> Facts do not "speak for themselves." They speak for or against competing theories. Facts divorced from theory or visions are mere isolated curiosities.

##-Thomas Sowell *A Conflict of Visions*

???
+ Facilitators develop the theme of data skepticism by talking about the importance of context to understanding numbers provided in analysis
+ An example I often use is "What if I told you there's a 2% drop in crime? What do we need to know to make that number useful?"
+ Facilitator emphasizes that the goal of analysis is telling a true and compelling story, and communicating context whenever possible

---

# 1. Problem Formulation
--

+ What question or need am I trying to answer?
--

+ What’s my organization’s mission and goals?
--

+ How can I best apply data to this task?

---

# 2. Data Gathering/Preliminary Analysis

--

+ What condition is it in?
--

+ Does it tell me what I need?
--

+ What other data might I need?
--

+ How much work do I need to put into the data?

---

# 3. Data Cleaning
--

+ Make the data usable and compatible
--

+ Takes up the most amount of time
--

+ May require more sophisticated tools depending on the state and size of the data

---

# 4. Hypothesis Testing
--

+ Am I getting the results I’d hoped for?
--

+ What other questions come up?
---

# 5. Verification
--

+ Do my results make sense?
--

+ Did I make a simple mistake?
