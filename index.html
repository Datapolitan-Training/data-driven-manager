# The Value of Data
--

+ Data tells a story about something that's happened
--

+ Can describe what happened directly or indirectly

???
+ Facilitators prompt students with the question "Why is data useful?" and/or "Why do we use it?"
+ Facilitators contrast this with the question "How would we make decisions without data?" to tease out the need for data to check assumptions and limited problem awareness
+ Facilitators carefully acknowledge that intuition, experience, and anecdotes can be useful but shouldn't be the sole source of knowledge and information

---

class: center,middle
# Are All Data Points Created Equal?
???
+ Facilitators lead a brief discussion of the issues with data
+ Issues to be touched on include: data entry errors, biases in data, data cleaning errors, etc.
---

class:middle
> Facts do not "speak for themselves." They speak for or against competing theories. Facts divorced from theory or visions are mere isolated curiosities.

##-Thomas Sowell *A Conflict of Visions*

???
+ Facilitators develop the theme of data skepticism by talking about the importance of context to understanding numbers provided in analysis
+ An example I often use is "What if I told you there's a 2% drop in crime? What do we need to know to make that number useful?"
+ Facilitator emphasizes that the goal of analysis is telling a true and compelling story, and communicating context whenever possible

# The Value of Data

>> We move from data to information to knowledge to wisdom. And separating one from the other... knowing the limitations and the danger of exercising on withou the others, while respecting each category of intelligence, is generally what serious education is about.

# 5 Data Analytics Tasks
--

1. Sorting
--

2. Filtering
--

3. Aggregating (PivotTable)
--

4. Manipulating
--

5. Visualizing

---

# 1. Sorting
--

+ Reorganize rows in a dataset based on the values in a column
--

+ Can sort on multiple columns

---

# Sorting by Date

![img-center-100](images/sort_overview.png)
--


![img-center-100](images/sort1.png)

---

# Sorting by Date
![img-center-65](images/sort4a.png)

![img-center-65](images/sort4b.png)


---

# Sorting by Date
![img-center-60](images/sort4.png)

![img-center-60](images/sort_final.png)

---

# 2. Filtering
--

+ Only show rows that contain some value
--

+ Can filter by multiple values
--

+ Can filter by values in multiple columns

---

# Filtering by Agency Name
![img-center-100](images/filtering1.png)

---

# Filtering by Agency Name
![img-center-40](images/filtering2.png)

---

# 3. Aggregating Data 
--

+ Trends only become clear in aggregate
--

+ Often where you discover the "so what"
--

+ Aggregating data meaningfully can be tricky

---
# PivotTables
--

+ A data summarization tool
--

+ Useful to quickly understand data
--

+ Can use to graph data totals
--



![img-center-100](images/pt1.png)

---

# Creating a PivotTable
![img-center-60](images/pt2.png)
--

+ Should default to all your data .red[unless you have any cells selected]
--

+ Should default to a new worksheet

---

# Creating a PivotTable
![img-right-40](images/pt3.png)
## Drag and drop fields to visualize
+ Row labels 
+ Values
+ Filter
+ Column Labels

---

# Creating a PivotTable
![img-center-100](images/pt4.png)

---

# 4. Manipulating Data (In a good way...)
--

+ Sometimes available categories don't make sense
--

+ Values may not be in the format you need (or have mistakes)
--

+ You always want to have a clean copy of the data to go back to
--

+ Best to keep track of what you've done


---

--

+ Quickly communicate information
--

+ Tell a clearer story
--

+ A picture is worth a thousands words

# Finding Context

![img-center-80](images/context.png)

---

# Exploratory Data Analysis
--

+ Goal -> Discover patterns in the data
--

+ Understand the context
--

+ Summarize fields
--

+ Use graphical representations of the data
--

+ Explore outliers

--

# Exploring the Data
???
+ Facilitator releases participants to explore the data on their own
+ Facilitator helps participants with any issues analyzing the data
+ Participants practice presentation skills and articulating their analysis to a group
+ Facilitators emphasize telling a story with data
--

+ Take a moment to find something interesting in the data
--

+ Work in pairs, groups, or on your own
--

+ Be prepared to share what you found and the steps you took to find it
--

+ We'll be around to help
