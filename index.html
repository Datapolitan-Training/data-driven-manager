--

+ How much does my need change given a different set of conditions?
--

+ How does X play into my organization’s mission and goals?
--

+ What’s the most meaningful way of quantifying X?
---

# 6 Analytical Steps
![img-center-90](images/sixphases_1.jpg)

---

# 1. Problem Formulation
--

+ What question or need am I trying to answer?
--

+ What’s my organization’s mission and goals?
--

+ How can I best apply data to this task?

---

# 2. Data Gathering/Preliminary Analysis
--

+ What data do I think I’m going to need?
--

+ What condition is it in?
--

+ Does it tell me what I need?
--

+ What other data might I need?
--

+ How much work do I need to put into the data?

---

# 3. Data Cleaning
--

+ Make the data usable and compatible
--

+ Takes up the most amount of time
--

+ May require more sophisticated tools depending on the state and size of the data

---

# 4. Hypothesis Testing
--

+ Am I getting the results I’d hoped for?
--

+ What other questions come up?
---

# 5. Verification
--

+ Do my results make sense?
--

+ Did I make a simple mistake?
--

+ Check twice and you’ll sleep easier
